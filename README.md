hello you may need to download muse hub for this program to work,
in order for this to work you need all the images and also an xml music reader i used musescore if you have one configured it should work.
https://musescore.org/en/download
that is the download for musescore, once downloaded make sure to open it or else it would reconigze that you have it and will keep telling to install it
in order to configue the xml reader run 
configure.run()
in the terminal 
https://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/
there is music21 documentatoin in case it's not working look there for help.

i used visual studio code becasue it was not working in replit for me. I would suggest copy pasting the code to run it.
